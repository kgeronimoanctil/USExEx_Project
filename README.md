# USExEx_Project
OCIO Data Science Lab - United States Exploring Expedition Project. Summer 2022 Internship  
  
The one called "us_exped_botany_week2.Rmd" is the only one that has code on it. The other csvs are the datasets that I am pulling from (noted in the first part of that rmd file) which were stored in a data_raw folder (so when they are read in, they are read in as if they were in this same data_raw folder).
